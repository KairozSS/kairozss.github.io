A blog I made for writing in English. It is not meant to be read by other people, seriously there is nothing of value here for you.

The whole purpose of this is that I produce the language in written form, instead of just reading or listening.

Most of the time I am probably going to write random sentences using specific words.

I am trying to find my own way of writing and speaking too. The common words I personally use, the common phrases I use.

Also, how to speak and write depending of the context. The different words English speakers use depending on the setting (formal/informal).

At the time of writing (December 8th, 2022), I still struggle with coming up with words fast enough to express what I think. I know what I want to say, but it takes time to translate my thoughts into words. So I figured if I want to become good at writing and speaking, I have to write and speak a lot and this way...

I'll become Quick With Words.
